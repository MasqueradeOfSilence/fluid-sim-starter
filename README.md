# fluid-sim-starter
Building off of Sean Flynn's "Fluid Sim Starter" repository. Filling in the pressure solve functions and extending to 3D.

NOTE: The only code that is mine is the pressure solving functionality. I may also extend it to 3 dimensions. After building this, I will go back to my original fluid-solver repo and implement a full version, which I will then use as a baseline for my MPM foam solver. More info TBA.
